# todo-trello
This project works with an Excel file for planning to do lists and a code to transport them to trello

It is composed of the following:
- A .xlsx file, to add tasks and detail them in subtasks and deadlines
- A python code generateToDoTrelloList.py that translates changes from the excel file to trello and the other way around

Additionally, user should have a Trello account
A tutorial to use the trello API is on the folowing colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nv2stIf4KCQi1uo6zD-pVxn94y8OAuNl

## To Do (brainstorming):
- add automatic Google Drive backup and restore (so you can run the code from any computer)
- put important variables from code into a configFile, which can be edited by the user 
- make a user ready package
- rewrite main code in OO style
- [SOON] Implement The Great Game of Knowledge
