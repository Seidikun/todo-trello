# todo-trello
This project works with an excel for planning to do lists and a code to transport them to trello

It is composed of the following:
- A .xlsx file, to add tasks and detail them in subtasks and deadlines
- A python code generateToDoTrelloList.py that translates changes from the excel file to trello and the other way around
